  "mobility": {
    "summary": "The robot has a mobile base with two continuous joints corresponding to left and right wheel links, allowing it to move in a differential drive manner. This enables the robot to navigate across different floors and environments for tasks such as cross-floor object rearrangement and home arrangement."

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "The robot has a sophisticated arm with multiple degrees of freedom, including prismatic and revolute joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist, gripper). This allows for complex manipulation tasks such as picking and placing objects, rearranging furniture, and handling objects in challenging positions like high shelves and under tables. The gripper with prismatic joints on both fingers further enhances precise object handling capabilities.",
