  "mobility": {
    "summary": "The DJIDrone features an aerial mobility base indicated by its name and structure. It lacks mobile joints indicating terrestrial locomotion and therefore is likely an aerial vehicle capable of multi-floor operations, suitable for tasks that involve vertical movement and cross-floor transport."
  },
  "perception": {
    "summary": "The DJIDrone is equipped with multiple sensors for perceiving its environment. It has a Velodyne sensor and a RealSense camera, the latter of which includes a depth optical frame. These sensors provide the drone with depth perception and detailed geometric information which are critical for object detection, necessary to search for and perceive objects for manipulation.",

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "There are no specific end effectors or manipulative joints mentioned in the provided structure, suggesting the DJIDrone may not have direct manipulation capabilities built-in. However, its sensing capabilities make it suitable for cooperative manipulation tasks, likely working in tandem with other manipulators.",
