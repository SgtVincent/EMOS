  "perception": {
    "summary": "The robot is equipped with a camera system mounted on its head, which includes a depth sensor, RGB camera, accelerometer, and gyroscope. The camera's positioning on the link_head allows for pan and tilt movements, enabling the robot to look around and perceive its environment. This is essential for cooperative perception and identifying objects for manipulation.",

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "The robot features an extendable arm with multiple prismatic joints (link_arm_l0 to link_arm_l4) and a wrist with revolute joints for yaw, pitch, and roll movements. It is equipped with a gripper that has revolute joints for two fingers, suitable for grasping and manipulating various objects. The mast and lift system, alongside the arm's reach, allows the robot to handle objects on high shelves and under tables, relevant for tasks such as home arrangement and object rearrangement.",
