    "summary": "The robot 'spot' has a quadrupedal structure with four legs, each having three revolute joints (hip, upper leg, and lower leg) which likely enables it to traverse a variety of terrains and potentially handle uneven surfaces. This configuration offers significant stability and mobility, making it capable of moving across floors, potentially including stairs or other complex ground features."
  },
  "perception": {
    "summary": "The robot is equipped with an articulated arm that includes a fixed camera at the end-effector (articulated_agent_arm_camera). This allows it to perceive its environment, specifically to gain geometric information about objects for manipulation tasks. The camera positioning on the arm gives it a dynamic range of viewing angles to effectively search for and identify objects in various positions and heights within a home environment.",

    "summary": "The robot is equipped with a dexterous arm that has multiple revolute joints from shoulder to finger (including shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers). This provides a high degree of freedom for precise manipulation tasks. The robot's arm can pick and place objects, which is essential for tasks such as cross-floor object rearrangement and home arrangement, including reaching high shelves or navigating under tables to manage misplaced items.",
