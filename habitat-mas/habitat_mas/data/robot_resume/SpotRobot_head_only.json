  "mobility": {
    "summary": "The robot has four limbs, each with three revolute joints (hip, upper leg, lower leg). These joints indicate that the robot is quadruped and capable of walking, climbing stairs, and navigating various terrains. This mobility allows the robot to move between floors and maneuver in different environments, which is crucial for the cross-floor object rearrangement and home arrangement tasks."
  },
  "perception": {
    "summary": "The robot is equipped with a head_camera mounted on a fixed joint. This camera likely provides visual feedback for the robot to perceive its environment, detect objects, and gather geometric information. This perception capability is essential for tasks that require cooperative perception for manipulation, such as searching for objects and assessing their positions in the environment.",

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "The robot has a sophisticated arm equipped with multiple revolute joints (sh0, sh1, hr0, el0, el1, wr0, wr1) terminating in a finger (fngr). This arm structure gives the robot a high degree of freedom and dexterity to perform complex manipulation tasks, like picking and placing objects in different locations. The manipulation capability is essential for rearranging objects, especially those in abnormal positions like on high shelves or under tables.",
