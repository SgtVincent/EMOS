    "summary": "The robot has a quadrupedal design consisting of four legs (front-left, front-right, hind-left, hind-right), each with three revolute joints (hip, upper leg, lower leg). This design allows it to navigate various terrains and maintain stability on uneven surfaces, enabling it to move around efficiently for tasks including cross-floor operations."

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "The robot is equipped with a multi-jointed arm featuring seven revolute joints and an additional gripper joint (arm0.link_fngr). This allows for precise and flexible manipulation of objects. Coupled with its perceptive capabilities, the robot can pick and place objects, including those in hard-to-reach areas like high shelves or under tables, fulfilling tasks such as cross-floor object rearrangement and home arrangement.",
