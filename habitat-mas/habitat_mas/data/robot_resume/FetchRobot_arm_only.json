  "perception": {
    "summary": "FetchRobot is equipped with a head camera system consisting of both RGB and depth cameras. The head cameras are mounted on links with revolute joints allowing panning and tilting, which provides a wide field of view. Additionally, there is a laser sensor on the fixed link, enhancing depth perception for environment mapping. This sensor suite allows for effective searching, perceiving, and obtaining geometric information of objects in various positions.",
