## Habitat-Lab and Habitat-Sim versions
Habitat-Lab: vX or master?
Habitat-Sim: vX or master?

Habitat is under active development, and we advise users to restrict themselves to stable releases. Are you using the latest release versions of [Habitat-Lab](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab/releases) and [Habitat-Sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/releases)? If not, why not?
(We may not be able to help with problems in earlier versions.) 

Master branch contains 'bleeding edge' code and should be used at your own risk.
